Backend written using Spring Boot for a Tamagotchi-like application, but the pets here are creatures
resembling monsters. The application allows you to create a creature and forces you to take regular
care. The user had to take care of his monster's health, hunger, thirst and willingness to play.

Communication with frontend is carried out with REST API. Application uses basic authorization and authentication whith using sessions.

Project is written with the use of MongoDB nosql database situated in Docker container.
